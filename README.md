## Notes

Some things that can be done to increase the quality of this repo if there was time:
 - Unit tests can be more exhaustive, especially around observables
 - Integrate sonarqube into the build pipeline to get more common issues surfaced sooner
 - Introduce either e2e or Selenium based tests for completness
 - Scope out further requirments so the proposed solution fits usage patterns better
